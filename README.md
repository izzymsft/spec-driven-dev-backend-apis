## Spec Driven Development - Backend APIs

This is an example project that demonstrates how to go about spec driven development using Visual Studio Code.

We will be using different LLMs to test the capability of VSCode

Then we will use the `humao.rest-client` [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to test the Backend APIs
